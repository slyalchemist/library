## Overview

Welcome to the Library Project! This project is an extension of an exercise from a lesson in The Odin Project in which we explored object constructors, and this project is meant to bring everything I've learned thus far together, with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and particularly DOM Manipulation. 

The main objective of this project is to create a website in which displays the user's library, and allows the user to add more books, change the 'read' status, and delete books. 

## Process

- My first steps for this project were to create the skeleton using HTML
- Once the HTML was mostly complete, I began setting up accepting user input and DOM Manipulation through JavaScript
- Once everything seemed to be working as desired, I styled the webpage.
